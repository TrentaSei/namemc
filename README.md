## Proxies
For proxies u'll need a provider, the one working i used in the video is [DataImpulse](https://dataimpulse.com/?aff=36026)

## How to use:
First of all please create a run.py file. You can just copy [example.py](https://github.com/rdavydov/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2/blob/master/example.py) and modify it according to your needs.
